# Sroloc: The Absurd Space Adventure

Welcome to this new project called "Sroloc: The Absurd Space Adventure." A video game developed with the [Phaser 3](https;//www.github.com/photonstorm/phaser) framework. You play as Sroloc, a sentient spaceship that has to pass through gates that appear on the infite void of space. This repository is the source code that is **still in development** so have a little patience and compassion to this pre pre pre pre alpha build!

## Running Sroloc in your computer

### Prerequisite

- Install [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in your computer (Use the LTS version for better implementation).

### Install Dependencies

Node JS comes with some version of NPM (Node Package Manager) used to install needed dependencies and packages. With this run the command `npm install` to add dependencies from `package.json` file.

### Building and Running the game
We use [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) to bundle and build all the dependencies that are in the `node_modules` folder so that your browser can run the game. Also Phaser 3 only works when running a server (local or connected to the internet). To build the project run `npm run build` and later run `npm start` to start the game and play it.

## ENJOY!

Have fun running this game on your local server, you are free to help in the development!
